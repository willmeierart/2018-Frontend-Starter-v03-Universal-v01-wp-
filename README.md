# 2018 Agency Zero Front-End Starter Project v0.3 (Universal v0.1)

## About

A modern web-dev standard for AZ projects making use of:
- React/Redux for UNIVERSAL UI/state-management
- SASS (node-sass-chokidar)
- Jest/Enzyme for testing
- more to come...

A work in progress. This third iteration is still formatted to communicate with the Wordpress REST API, but is a massive refactor from previous versions in that it is configured to run isomorphically on both server and client sides simultaneously.
